# Tami's dotfiles
This repository contains my dotflies in an unorderly fashion. Some applications have folders, some only have *".conf"* files.

## **Don't run start.fish**
The script deletes your dotfiles or even whole folders and tries to simlinks the ones in this repo. And the symlinks are **not configured** to work with different folder setups.
